Why txtIt?

I decided to make this website to apply and further my knowledge on the following tools: html, css, flask, python3 and postgresql. This website is being developed on ubuntu. This webste will be base from the tutorial project at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/

Goals:

1. Figure out how to format/style this md file (make it look decent).
2. Host it either on heroku or my rasberrypi 4. Preferrably heroku at first since I will probalby need to use heroku on my college course.
3. Use postgresql as database (for the added challenge of diverting from the most tutorials).
4. Avoid searching for tutorials of anyhing similar like the flask tutorial, or tutorials that make a website that is similar to this one.

Technologies I being used:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Python3
4. Flask
5. Postgresql
6. Jinja2

Flask alchemy 
Psycopg2 was installed because it is the adapter that allows psqlalchemy to work with postgresql.
Flask migrate was installed(tool that helps us interact with databases and tables).

After following along https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/flask/flask-postgresql I will divert from the tutorial and make a simpler flask without the use of the app factory, as my understandng of flask is limited and and the tutorial was not enough for me to such 
a change to the app.
