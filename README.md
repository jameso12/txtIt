Why txtIt?

I decided to make this website to apply and further my knowledge on the following tools: html, css, flask, python3 and postgresql.

Goals:

1. Figure out how to format/style this md file (make it look decent).
2. Host it either on heroku or my rasberrypi 4. Preferrably heroku at first since I will probalby need to use heroku on my college course.
3. Use postgresql as database (for the added challenge of diverting from the most tutorials).
4. Avoid searching for tutorials of anyhing similar like the flask tutorial, or tutorials that make a website that is similar to this one.

Technologies I plan on using:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Python3
4. Flask
5. Postgresql
